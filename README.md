This project contains the programs necessary to determine stride length and stride frequency from a video of a sprint. <br /><br />
  VideoImport: pulls the video from the cloud <br />
  TrackExtraction: determines the distance <br />
  ShoeDetection: determines the shoe <br />
  StrideLength: maps the shoe's displacement relative to the track to calculate the stride length <br />
  Main: contains all the functions necessary to run the program <br />
