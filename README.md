This project contains the programs necessary to determine stride length and stride frequency from a video of a sprint.
  VideoImport: pulls the video from the cloud
  TrackExtraction: determines the distance
  ShoeDetection: determines the shoe
  StrideLength: maps the shoe's displacement relative to the track to calculate the stride length
  Main: contains all the functions necessary to run the program
